h1. ArduGPIO

ArduGPIO is a simple Arduino codebase to support development of General Purpose Input/Output applications, primarily for users interfacing with broadcast equipment.

h2. Features

* Set pin modes (input/output)
* Set pin high/low
* Query current pin status
* Query analog pin value
* Pin changes broadcast upon edge detected/significant analog change

h2. Interfacing Hardware to Arduinos

<TODO>

h2. Still to do

* Debounce pin change broadcasts
* Setting PWM outputs
* Easier configuration between Arduino boards (def. config is good for Uno/Duem/Dicem)
